Prompt 2: Ramp Numbers
A ramp number is a number whose digits from left to right either only rise or stay the same. 1234 is a ramp number and so is 1124 and 13569. But 1032 is not and neither is 1528.

Challenge: Given the input of a number, build a program that will find the total number of ramp numbers that are less than it.

Example:


Code Example
  const numOfRampsBelow = (num) => {
    //  Your code goes here
  }

  numOfRampsBelow(99999) // => "2001 total ramp numbers are less than 99999"

Example 2
  Given: A positive integer, n.

  Output: The number of total ramp numbers less than n.

  Example input: 123

  Example output: 65 total ramp numbers are less than 123

Instructions
  1. First build this project in the terminal
  2. Then attach it to the DOM
  3. Work through the challenge together
  4. As always whiteboard it and make a code plan
  5. Translate from English to pseudo code then to JavaScript
  6. When you finish work on the Further Practice Challenge
  7. Test
  8. Present to class
  9. Turn in the URL to your repo, once for each person in your group

Push Yourself Further
  Further Practice Challenge - Display all of the ramp numbers that are less than the input number (n).
